            <h3>The Zoo Problem</h3>

                <p>
                    The Zoo Problem project helps new zookeeper interns get acquainted with zoo animals at the Wild
                    Animal
                    Mini-Zoo as part of their onboarding process. My team has included each animal type, resident names,
                    animal facts, and general description that interns can refer back to as they are trained for their
                    summer internship. This project showcases use of HTML.

            <h3>My Grocery List</h3>


                <p>
                    The online Grocery List is meant to help users create, view, and modify their grocery lists online
                    for
                    ease of access. Users will cease to lose or forget their paper grocery lists in favor of the new
                    online
                    list! Users can create sections based on food type and organize their lists as they prefer. This
                    project
                    showcases use of HTML and CSS.

            <h3>Steven's Book Shop</h3>

                <p>
                    Steven's Book Shop is a project I created for a client to create an online bookstore application for
                    his
                    small business. Users can navigate through featured books to read a description and submit feedback
                    based on their experience with the application.
