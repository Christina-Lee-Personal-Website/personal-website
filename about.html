        <h2>Dancing</h2>
        <p class="hobby-paragraph">I started dancing when I was 8 years old following in the footsteps of my older sister. I started with ballet, tap, and jazz and focused more on contemporary once I reached high school. In college and beyond, I took more hip hop and choreography classes and eventually joined a local competitive team in the Bay Area. Now, I enjoy taking classes every once in a while, learning from new teachers, and trying new styles.</p>
